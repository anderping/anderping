Also, check out my last app __"Application Filler"__ (work in progress), where I combine LLM, web scraping and SQL databases:

__About me__:

*I am an Industrial Technology Engineer with an MS in Space Science and Technology, on which I have built my knowledge and experience in programming applied to data science and AI.*

*It was in my last work experience at Koalition that I was able to collaborate in the development of AI software applications. My role encompassed supporting the creation of ML models for data analysis and contributing to the integration of APIs for AI-based applications using NLP tools.*

*This role is based on my studies in programming and passion for technology. After working both in the space and electricity industries I decided to study Python, specifically data analysis and data science (also in R), as well as data bases (SQL), being now capable of applying Machine Learning algorithms for data prediction (including the use of frameworks such as Tensorflow to apply Neural Networks) and with knowledge in platforms such as MLFlow, JupyterLab and Vertex AI), besides being able to work in team projects with the use of GIT and GitHub.*

*Before that I worked as a mechanism design engineer in the space industry and afterwards I was offered an opportunity to work in the electrical industry at the multinational Iberdrola, and was later moved to Scotland to work at the Protections and Control team. I consider myself curious and hard-working, so I continuously seek to expand my knowledge and skills for my professional development.*
