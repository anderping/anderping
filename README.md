__About me__:

*Hi!* 

*I am an industrial Technology Engineer with an MSc in Space Science and Technology. I have built on this qualification to develop my knowledge and experience of programming for Data Science and AI.*

*During my last work placement at Koalition, I collaborated on the development of AI software applications. My role involved supporting the creation of Machine Learning (ML) models for data analysis, and contributing to the integration of APIs for applications based on the use of locally deployed Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools (Ollama and Langchain).*

*Having worked in the space and electrical industries, I decided to spend some time studying Python, with a focus on analytics and data science (as well as R), and databases (SQL and MongoDB). I furthered my learning at the BBK Data Science Bootcamp, in collaboration with The Bridge. I am now able to apply machine learning (ML) algorithms for data prediction, including the use of frameworks such as TensorFlow for neural networks, and I have knowledge of platforms such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Oracle, MLFlow, JupyterLab and Vertex AI. I can also work on team projects using Git, GitHub and Docker, and make deployments with Flask.*
