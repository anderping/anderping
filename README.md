I am an industrial technology engineer with a MS in Space Technology and coding and Data Science experience. I have worked as a mechanism design engineer in the space industry and afterwards the electrical industry at the multinational Iberdrola, and was later moved to Scotland to work at the Protections and Control team. Here I developed equipment for high voltage substations through analysis and calculation, and I discovered an increasing interest in coding and state of the art technology. 

I consider myself curious and hard-working, so I continuously seek to expand my knowledge and skills for my professional development. I then dedicated some time to study Python, specifically data analysis and data science (also in R), as well as data bases (SQL), being now capable of applying Machine Learning algorithms for data prediction.
